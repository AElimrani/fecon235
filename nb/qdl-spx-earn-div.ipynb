    "\"I expect annual earning growth of 8%,\n",
    "and in ten years a terminal price/earning ratio of 14 --\n",
    "given that ratio is 15.5 currently,\n",
    "such a 1% reduction per annum will decrease\n",
    "the total return by like amount.\n",
    "Therefore, with a dividend yield of 3%,\n",
    "the my expected total return is 8% - 1% + 3% = 10%\n",
    "over the coming decade.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows the percentage approximate reasoning\n",
    "is prone is large errors, whereas a logarithmic version\n",
    "is exact. The data since 1871 allows us to examine\n",
    "the separable components of total return:\n",
    "enterprise and speculative returns, plus dividend yield.\n"
