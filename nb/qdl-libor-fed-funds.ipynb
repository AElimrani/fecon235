    "We examine the spread between two interest rates: LIBOR and Fed Funds. The former has a much greater depth in the futures market in terms of volume and maturity horizon, which implies richer information content. We will seek out their relationship, and then construct a synthetic forward Fed Funds rate. This is useful in gauging market sentiment regarding Fed policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **30-day Federal Funds futures incorporates market expectations of the average *daily* Federal Funds Effective Rate (FFER) levels *during* a given contract month**. The FFER is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York each day, and is calculated as a transaction-volume weighted average of the previous dayâ€™s rates on trades arranged by major brokers for overnight unsecured loans between depository institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the futures on LIBOR (CME Eurodollars contract) has a tenor of 3-months with tremendous trading volume extending out for years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our synthetic forward Fed Funds *estimates* the expected average FFER *during* a given contract month. This is measure is more meaningful than the probability of Fed rate hike currently in vogue, since it is an estimate generated from a highly active futures market curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we shall sum up with one number to this simple question: **How much is the Fed Funds expected to change over the next 12 months?**"
