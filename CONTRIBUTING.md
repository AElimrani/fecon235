# CONTRIBUTING: Notes on forks and pull requests

- If you have modified code in a IPython notebook where 
  there are many embedded images, please clear out all 
  outputs before your commit. (The only exception arises 
  in the case of major releases where we want archival 
  samples of images generated).

Thanks very much for your consideration. Looking forward 
to reviewing your code.
